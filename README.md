## Query 1

During the installation process after typing pip3 install surround it throws an syntax error. Can anyone help?

### Screenshot: This is my syntax error.

### Solution
Probably the path for pip3 is not set in your system. Just find the pip3 in your system. If it is not available just reinstall your python 3. Since, it has pip3 by default. Then retry the pip3 install surround without using ‘!’ in front of the command. 

## Query 2

After typing the  pip3 install surround it shows an invalid syntax. I have set path to python and pip as well then also it shows the same error.

### Solution
Don’t give the !pip3 install surround inside python. Just set the path for the pip and type pip3 install surround in the command prompt itself.
